# Github stale

Parse github repos out of some online document (eg one of those "here are 1000 repo links about this technology" pages), load info about each repo and sort them by last commit.
VERY rudimentary right now. I'm not sure I am interested enough to keep working on this, we'll see.
The idea is to filter out stale or deprecated repos.

TODO:
- output a web document or something (maybe a mini web app?)
- github stars and watchers
- repo descriptions
- customized sorting (by date right now)
- search for key words such as "deprecated" (that are h3+, to filter conversational stuff?)
